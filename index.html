        <h3>K2</h3>
        <img src="https://fthmb.tqn.com/A5Ea9-oWf0iJrQer3c0voOZRAM8=/768x0/filters:no_upscale()/k2_70009246-56a16a343df78cf7726a881f.jpg" width="100%">
        <p>K2, the second highest mountain in the world, is also one of the most difficult mountains to climb, surpassing even Mt. Everest in this regard. It was first climbed by an Italian team comprising of Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni on 31st July, 1954. Lacedelli and Compagnoni was subsequently presented with the Knight of the Grand Cross, Italy’s highest honour. K2’s first ascent is not free from controversy as Lacedelli and Compagnoni are noted for leaving Walter Bonatti (a young italian) and Amir Mehdi (pakistani) outdoors to survive an open bivouac by setting up camp further uphill than agreed upon. Bonatti and Mehdi had trekked to deliver oxygen tanks to Lacedelli and Compagnoni, but as Bonatti was younger and considerably fit, it is said that Compagnoni deliberately misled Bonatti and Mehdi as he didn’t want Bonatti to reach the peak of K2. As a result of having to survive the bivouac, Mehdi lost his toes to frostbite.</p>

        <h3>Kangchenjunga</h3>
        <img src="http://justfunfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kangchenjunga.jpg" width="100%">
        <p>Kangchenjunga is the third highest mountain in the world and was first climbed on 25th May, 1955 by Britishers George Band and Joe Brown. Interestingly, the climbers didn’t actually reach the peak, but stopped 10 feet short as a show of respect for the religious feelings of the Chogyal (the then monarchs of Sikkim and Ladakh). Band was the youngest member of the British Expedition to mount Everest, where Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay made the first ascent of Everest. </p>

        <p>Namcha Barwa has a height of 7782 metres and was the highest unclimbed independent mountain in the world till 1992 when it was climbed by a joint Chinese-Japanese expedition. The peak was first climbed in 1992 after several unsuccessful attempts. In 1991, the joint Chinese-Japanese expedition almost made it to the top but had to stop 220 m short of the summit because of violent winds and snowfall. Hiroshi Onishi, who was the main climber in the expedition died in an avalanche. A key factor in the success of the second expedition was the study of weather patterns based on the data from the previous expeditions.</p>

        <h3>Nanda Devi</h3>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Mt._Nanda_Devi.jpg/1920px-Mt._Nanda_Devi.jpg" width="100%">
        <p>Nanda Devi is the highest mountain in India after Kangchenjunga. It was first climbed on 29th August, 1936 by Britishers Noel Odell and Bill Tilman who led an Anglo-American expedition to the mountain. Noel Odell was an oxygen officer in 1924 Everest expedition in which George Mallory and Andrew Irvine lost their lives. Odell was the last person to see Mallory and Irvine alive and believed till 1925 that they had made it to the Second Step from which the chances of reaching the summit were substantial. He later changed his belief due to scepticism from the climbing community and conceded that he may have seen them at the First Step. After being declared too old for the next Everest expedition, he went back to claiming that he had seen Mallory and Irvine make it to the second step. After 50 years of extensive exploration, a route was found into the Sanctuary which made it possible to climb the peak in 1936 after three failed attempts by Hugh Ruttledge in the 1930s.</p>
